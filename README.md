Capstone Project 1: React Application with External API Integration.

Project 1 Assignment: React Application with External API Integration
This assignment challenges you to use React and asynchronous JavaScript to build a functioning, front-end-only app that fetches data from an external API. You'll apply skills in:

Component structure and reuse
Asynchronous fetching
Controlled components
State management
UI design and navigation
Scenario
You're working at a startup that wants a prototype app built entirely in React. The app must fetch real-world data and allow users to interact with it. The API may be public and unauthenticated, or it may require simple token-based access.

Your job is to define the scope and design of the product, build the React application, and document your work clearly for stakeholder presentation.

Instructions
Choose an external API ( Use the GitHub: Public APIsLinks to an external site. for ideas).
Design a small app around a user goal (e.g., look up recipes, get space facts, find books).
Build your app using React. Include:
Routing (e.g., using React Router)
Dynamic rendering of API results
Styling/layout
Write a README that includes:
Project title & description
Setup instructions
API used and endpoint(s)
Any challenges or known bugs
Submission and Grading Criteria
Review the rubric below as a guide for how this lab will be graded.
Complete your assignment using your preferred IDE.
When you are ready, push your final script to a public GitHub. Your public GitHub repository should include:
Project title & description
Setup instructions
API used and endpoint(s)
Any challenges or known bugs
(Optionally) deployed URL (Netlify, Vercel, etc.)
Share the link to your GitHub repo below to submit your assignment.

Here is more context:

In this project, you'll build a React application that consumes data from a public third-party API. This project emphasizes frontend design, client-side routing, state management, and asynchronous data fetching. It gives you hands-on practice creating a real-world interface that users can interact with, based on live external data.

You'll have full creative control over the type of app you build, whether it's a weather dashboard, cryptocurrency tracker, trivia game, recipe finder, or something else that interests you.

Scenario

Imagine you're working at a startup that’s building a lightweight consumer-facing web app. Your product needs to display up-to-date information from an external data source in a clean, interactive interface.

Your task is to identify a useful or engaging public API, design a simple product around that data, and deliver a working React application that provides users with a seamless experience. This is your chance to show how you can integrate external data into a modern user interface, just like a front-end developer would on a real product team.

In future projects (Projects 2 and 3), you'll write your own API and design your own business scenario. You’ll be responsible for clearly describing the problem your app solves and why your full-stack solution makes sense. This project is your foundation for making those design choices. While choosing your API and planning your React app, consider:

Considerations

What problem am I solving for users?

Who is my user? Who would use this application?

How does a user interact with my application? What would a user expect from this application?

Example Consideration Answers

Here are some examples to how you could answer the above questions. Note: this should be specific to your project.

Example: “City Weather Dashboard” (using OpenWeatherMap API)

What problem am I solving for users?

Many users want to quickly check weather conditions for travel or daily planning without navigating through ad-heavy or cluttered apps. This dashboard gives a clean, focused summary of current weather and a 5-day forecast for any city.

Who is my user? Who would use this application?

The typical user is someone who travels frequently or lives in an area with variable weather. This might include commuters, parents planning daily activities, or digital nomads checking different cities.

How does a user interact with my application? What would a user expect from this application?

Users enter a city name into the search bar and immediately receive current weather data (temperature, description, wind, humidity) and a short-term forecast. Users expect clear visuals (icons for sun, clouds, rain, etc.) and fast response times without needing to register or log in.

Example: “Space Explorer” (NASA Image & Info API)

What problem am I solving for users?

Space and astronomy fans often want curated, engaging visuals and explanations from NASA, but the official site can be dense or difficult to explore casually. This app creates an easy-to-navigate experience centered around discovery.

Who is my user? Who would use this application?

Students, teachers, or casual science enthusiasts--anyone who wants to view interesting NASA photos and learn about planets, galaxies, or space missions in a quick, visual format.

How does a user interact with my application? What would a user expect from this application?

The homepage shows the Astronomy Picture of the Day with a description. A navigation bar allows users to browse other categories like Mars Rover photos or search for content by date. Users expect stunning images, smooth loading, and brief, readable explanations.

Example: “Nutrition Label Lookup” (USDA FoodData Central API)

What problem am I solving for users?

People with dietary needs often struggle to find trustworthy nutrition information for everyday foods. This app provides instant access to verified data in a simplified layout.

Who is my user? Who would use this application?

Health-conscious users, such as athletes, people tracking calories or macros, or users managing health conditions or food allergies.

How does a user interact with my application? What would a user expect from this application?

Users type in a food item (e.g., “banana” or “chicken breast”) and receive nutrition data like calories, protein, fat, and sugar per serving. They expect clean labels, accuracy, and the ability to copy or export data if needed.

Problem Solving Process

This project follows the same structured approach you'll use in real-world development. Use these steps to plan and execute:

Define the Problem

What user problem does your app solve?

What API will provide meaningful data?

Determine the Design

What views or features does the app need?

How will the data be fetched and displayed?

Develop the Code

Structure your components.

Handle asynchronous fetching.

Add state and conditional rendering.

Style the interface.

Test, Debug, and Refine

Handle errors (loading states, failed fetches).

Test all routes and user flows.

Debug any unexpected behavior.

Document and Maintain

Write clear comments and commit messages.

Create a README with setup instructions.

Record and submit your video presentation.

Write a reflection on your process.

Resources and Tools

You are responsible for selecting the API and building the entire React frontend. Here’s what you’ll need:

Required Tools

ReactLinks to an external site.

JavaScript (ES6+)

JSXLinks to an external site.

GitLinks to an external site. & GitHubLinks to an external site.

Code Editor or IDE (VisualStudioCode)

Optional Tools

React RouterLinks to an external site.

Tailwind CSSLinks to an external site., Chakra UILinks to an external site., or another styling library

A hosting provider with a free tier such as NetlifyLinks to an external site. or VercelLinks to an external site.

API Discovery Resources

GitHub: Public APIsLinks to an external site.

Rapid APILinks to an external site.

API ListLinks to an external site.

You’ll want to pick a free, open API and one that ideally does not require an API key. Be sure to read the API documentation thoroughly, especially endpoints, rate limits, and key requirements. It’s recommended you test the API in Postman before building, as you may find you need to pivot to a different API.
